# CM CLI - Containerized

This repo builds a simple container with the [cm-cli](https://github.com/open-cluster-management/cm-cli) for interacting with ACM/OCM apis - as well as a few other common tools like an up-to-date `oc`.  

## Automatic Builds

This container should automatically rebuild and push every week.
